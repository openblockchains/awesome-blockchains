## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) & Answers


**Q: What's a Blockchain?**

A: A blockchain is a distributed database with a list (that is, chain) of records (that is, blocks) linked and secured by
digital fingerprints (that is, cryptho hashes).
Example from [`blockchain.rb`](blockchain.rb/blockchain.rb):

```
[#<Block:0x1eed2a0
  @timestamp     = 1637-09-15 20:52:38,
  @data          = "Genesis",
  @previous_hash = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  @hash          = "edbd4e11e69bc399a9ccd8faaea44fb27410fe8e3023bb9462450a0a9c4caa1b">,
 #<Block:0x1eec9a0
  @timestamp     = 1637-09-15 21:02:38,
  @data          = "Transaction Data...",
  @previous_hash = "edbd4e11e69bc399a9ccd8faaea44fb27410fe8e3023bb9462450a0a9c4caa1b",
  @hash          = "eb8ecbf6d5870763ae246e37539d82e37052cb32f88bb8c59971f9978e437743">,
 #<Block:0x1eec838
  @timestamp     = 1637-09-15 21:12:38,
  @data          = "Transaction Data......",
  @previous_hash = "eb8ecbf6d5870763ae246e37539d82e37052cb32f88bb8c59971f9978e437743",
  @hash          = "be50017ee4bbcb33844b3dc2b7c4e476d46569b5df5762d14ceba9355f0a85f4">,
  ...
```

**Q: What's a Hash? What's a (One-Way) Crypto(graphic) Hash Digest Checksum**?

A: A hash e.g. `eb8ecbf6d5870763ae246e37539d82e37052cb32f88bb8c59971f9978e437743`
is a small digest checksum calculated
with a one-way crypto(graphic) hash digest checksum function
e.g. SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256 Bits)
from the data. Example from [`blockchain.rb`](blockchain.rb/blockchain.rb):

```ruby
def calc_hash
  sha = Digest::SHA256.new
  sha.update( @timestamp.to_s + @previous_hash + @data )
  sha.hexdigest   ## returns "eb8ecbf6d5870763ae246e37539d82e37052cb32f88bb8c59971f9978e437743"
end
```

A blockchain uses

- the block timestamp (e.g. `1637-09-15 20:52:38`) and
- the hash from the previous block (e.g. `edbd4e11e69bc399a9ccd8faaea44fb27410fe8e3023bb9462450a0a9c4caa1b`) and finally
- the block data (e.g. `Transaction Data...`)

to calculate the new hash digest checksum, that is, the hash
e.g. `be50017ee4bbcb33844b3dc2b7c4e476d46569b5df5762d14ceba9355f0a85f4`.


**Q: What's a Merkle Tree?**

A: A Merkle tree is a hash tree named after Ralph Merkle who patented the concept in 1979
(the patent expired in 2002). A hash tree is a generalization of hash lists or hash chains where every leaf node (in the tree) is labelled with a data block and every non-leaf node (in the tree)
is labelled with the crypto(graphic) hash of the labels of its child nodes. For more see the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) Wikipedia Article.

Note: By adding crypto(graphic) hash functions you can "merkelize" any data structure.


**Q: What's a Merkelized DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?**

A: It's a blockchain secured by crypto(graphic) hashes that uses a directed acyclic graph data structure (instead of linear "classic" linked list).

Note: Git uses merkelized dag (directed acyclic graph)s for its blockchains.


**Q: Is the Git Repo a Blockchain?**

A: Yes, every branch in the git repo is a blockchain.
The "classic" Satoshi-blockchain is like a git repo with a single master branch (only).

Comments from the [reddit ruby posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/70c30f/build_your_own_blockchain_in_20_lines_of_ruby/):

> Wait, so a blockchain is just a linked list?
>
>> No. A linked list is only required to have a reference to the previous element, a block must
>> have an identifier depending on the previous block's identifier, meaning that you cannot
>> replace a block without recomputing every single block that comes after.
>> In this implementation that happens as the previous digest is input in the calc_hash method.



**What about Proof of Work / Waste?**

Let's add a proof of work / waste to the blockchain. In the classic blockchain you have to compute a block hash that starts with leading zeros (`00`). The more leading zeros the harder (more difficult) to compute. Let's keep it easy to compute with two leading zeros (`00`), that is, 16^2 = 256 possibilites (^1,2). Three leading zeros (`000`) would be 16^3 = 4_096 possibilites and four zeros (`0000`) would be 16^4 = 65_536 and so on.

(^1): 16 possibilties because it's a hex or hexadecimal or base 16 number, that is, `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `6` `7` `8` `9` `a` (10) `b` (11) `c` (12) `d` (13) `e` (14) `f` (15).

(^2): A random secure hash algorithm needs on average 256 tries (might be lets say 305 tries, for example, because it's NOT a perfect statistic distribution of possibilities).


Example:

```ruby
def compute_hash_with_proof_of_work( difficulty="00" )
  nonce = 0
  loop do
    hash = calc_hash_with_nonce( nonce )
    if hash.start_with?( difficulty )
      return [nonce,hash]     ## bingo! proof of work if hash starts with leading zeros (00)
    else
      nonce += 1              ## keep trying (and trying and trying)
    end
  end
end

def calc_hash_with_nonce( nonce=0 )
  sha = Digest::SHA256.new
  sha.update( nonce.to_s + @timestamp.to_s + @previous_hash + @data )
  sha.hexdigest
end
```

(Source: [`blockchain_with_proof_of_work.rb`](blockchain.rb/blockchain_with_proof_of_work.rb))

Let's rerun the sample with the proof of work machinery added.
Now the sample will pretty print (pp) something like:

```

```

See the difference? All hashes now start with leading zeros (`00`) and the nonce is the random "lucky number"
that makes it happen. That's the magic behind the proof of work.


##### Blockchain from Scratch - JavaScript Version

```js
class Block {

  constructor(data, previousHash) {
    this.timestamp    = new Date()
    this.data         = data
    this.previousHash = previousHash
    this.hash         = this.calcHash()
  }

  calcHash() {
    var sha = SHA256.create()
    sha.update( this.timestamp.toString() + this.previousHash + this.data )
    return sha.hex()
  }

  static first( data="Genesis" ) {    // create genesis (big bang! first) block
    // uses all-zero previousHash
    return new Block( data, "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" )
  }

  static next( previous, data="Transaction Data..." ) {
    return new Block( data, previous.hash )
  }
}


//////
// let's get started
//   build a blockchain a block at a time

b0 = Block.first( "Genesis" )
b1 = Block.next( b0, "Transaction Data..." )
b2 = Block.next( b1, "Transaction Data......" )
b3 = Block.next( b2, "More Transaction Data..." )


blockchain = [b0, b1, b2, b3]

console.log( blockchain )
```

(Source: [`blockchain.js`](blockchain.js/blockchain.js))

will log something like:

**BEWARE: Bitcoin is a gigantic ponzi scheme¹.
To the moon!? The new gold standard!?
Do NOT "invest" trying to get-rich-quick HODLing.
Why not? The bitcoin code is archaic and out-of-date.
Burn, baby, burn! Proof-of-work / waste is a global
energy environmental disaster
using 300 kW/h per bitcoin transaction (!) that's about 179 kilograms of CO₂ emissions².
Programmable money (or the internet of value)
for all future generations with (bitcoin) script
without loops and jumps (gotos) and all "stateless"!? LOL.**

¹: (Source: [Best of Bitcoin Maximalist - Scammers, Morons, Clowns, Shills & BagHODLers - Inside The New New Crypto Ponzi Economics](https://bitsblocks.github.io/bitcoin-maximalist))

²: Assuming let's say 0.596 kilograms of CO₂ per kW/h
(that's the energy efficiency in Germany) that's
about 179 kilograms of CO₂ per bitcoin transaction (300 kW/h × 0.596 kg). For more insights see the [Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption).

## Blockchain (Lite) Crypto Hash Libraries

[Ruby](#ruby) •
[JavaScript](#javascript)


### Ruby

**blockchain.lite** (github: [openblockchains/blockchain.lite.rb](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain.lite.rb),
gem: [blockchain-lite](https://rubygems.org/gems/blockchain-lite)) -
build your own blockchain with crypto hashes -
revolutionize the world with blockchains, blockchains, blockchains one block at a time

```ruby
require 'blockchain-lite'

b0 = Block.first( "Genesis" )
b1 = Block.next( b0, "Transaction Data..." )
b2 = Block.next( b1, "Transaction Data......" )
b3 = Block.next( b2, "More Transaction Data..." )

blockchain = [b0, b1, b2, b3]

pp blockchain
```

will pretty print (pp) something like:

```
[#<Block:0x1eed2a0
  @timestamp     = 1637-09-15 20:52:38,
  @data          = "Genesis",
  @previous_hash = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

build your own blockchain with crypto hashes -
revolutionize the world with blockchains, blockchains, blockchains one block at a time

```js
const Blocks = require( "blockchain-lite" )

// use basic block
let Block = Blocks.basic

let b0 = Block.first( 'Genesis' )
let b1 = Block.next( b0, 'Transaction Data...' )
let b2 = Block.next( b1, 'Transaction Data......' )
let b3 = Block.next( b2, 'More Transaction Data...' )

let blockchain = [b0, b1, b2, b3]

console.log( blockchain )
```

will log something like:

```
