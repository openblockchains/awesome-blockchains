# Awesome Proofs

A curated list of proofs for finding consensus / for finding truth. 


## Proof of Work / Proof of Waste (PoW)

Using a lottery to pick the winner - to "play" you have to "work" - the more you "work" the bigger your chances to win.


## Proof of Stake (PoS)


## Proof of Authority (PoA)

## Proof of Person / Proof of Personhood (PoP)


## Proof of Importance (PoI)

## Proof of Activity (PoA)


## Proof of Burn


## Proof of Capacity


### Proof of Storage 

### Proof of Space



## Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)

Invented By Chipmaker Intel. 
The algorithm uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) 
to ensure blocks get produced in a random lottery fashion, but without the required work.



## Proof of Pudding (PoP)

Proverb - "You can only say something is a success after it has been tried out or used."
